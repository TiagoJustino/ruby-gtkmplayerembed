= Gtk::MPlayerEmbed

== Overview

This is a widget for embedding MPlayer into Ruby/GTK applications using the
XEMBED protocol.

The widgets embeds MPlayer in a <tt>Gtk::Socket</tt> and an
<tt>AspectFrame</tt> to constrain it to an aspect ratio, which is
automatically detected from MPlayer's output. Additionally, the widget is
wrapped in a <tt>EventBox</tt> to enable fancy splash screens.

Keyboard bindings are automatically read from the MPlayer config file if it
can be found. The menu is disabled by default, since you can't use the arrow
keys to navigate it. But you may add additional bindings and enable it by
passing custom command-line arguments.

Fullscreen mode is emulated by creating a new window and reparenting the
widget to it. When switching back again, the widget may get wrongly packed in
the former parent container. Use the <tt>fullscreen-toggled</tt> signal to
rectify this, or overwrite the <tt>toggle_fullscreen</tt> method for more
complex situations.

== Usage

See the sample player and the RDoc documentation for some examples.

== Bugs

I only tested this on Linux with Ruby 1.8.5, Ruby/GTK 0.15 and GTK 2.10.
MPLayer video output only works correctly with xv, sdl creates another window,
and x11, gl and gl2 don't scale to the available space.

If the Ruby interpreter dies because of a GTK crash or something, an
MPlayer instance may be left running in the background.
